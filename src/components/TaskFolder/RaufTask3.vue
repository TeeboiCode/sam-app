        <h2>Rewriting Skills</h2>
        <p>
          For some writers, it isn't getting the original words on paper that's
          the challenge, but rewriting the first and second drafts. Using the
          random paragraph generator can be a good way to get into a rewriting
          routine before beginning the project. In this case, you take the
          random paragraph and rewrite it so it retains the same meaning, but
          does so in a better and more concise way. Beginning the day doing this
          with a random paragraph can make the rewriting of an article, short
          story, or chapter of a book much easier than trying to begin directly
          with it.

        <h2>Overcome Writers' Block</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to writers' block, often the most difficult part is
          simply beginning to put words to paper. One way that can often help is
          to write about something completely different from what you're having
          the writers' block about. This is where a random paragraph can be
          quite helpful. By using this tool you can begin to chip away at the
          writers' block by simply adding to the random paragraph that appears
          with the knowledge that it's going to be completely different from any
          writing you've been doing. Then once you begin to put words on the
          paper, it should be easier to transition into the writing that needs
          to get done.

        <h2>Difficult Writing Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          For those who are looking for a difficult writing challenge, the
          random paragraph generator can provide that as well. Instead of
          writing about the entire paragraph, take each sentence in the
          paragraph and make each of those individual sentences the first or
          last sentence of each paragraph of a short story. Trying this
          difficult writing challenge should stretch your creativity to the
          limit. The best way to use these random paragraphs is to generate a
          few and see how they can help with whatever project you're currently
          pursuing. You should be able to figure out quickly if this tool will
          be beneficial for your project or needs. Often times the best way to
          see if it's what you've been looking for is to use it and find out for
          yourself. We're always seeking constructive ideas on how we can
          improve our random paragraph generator. If you have used this tool and
          have an idea on how we could improve it for the benefit of everyone,
          we'd love to hear from you. Take a moment to email us with your ideas
          so we can consider them for future updates. Buying rate Proportion
